    "question": "Consider the following code segment:\n\nint x = 5;\nint y = 10;\nif (x < y) {\n    System.out.println(\"x is less than y\");\n}\n\nWhat is printed as a result of executing the code segment?",
    "options": [
      "x is less than y",
      "y is less than x",
      "Nothing is printed",
      "An error occurs"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "x is less than y",
    "explanation": "Since x = 5 and y = 10, the condition x < y is true, so 'x is less than y' is printed."

    "question": "Which of the following best describes the purpose of a constructor in Java?",
    "options": [
      "To define a new data type",
      "To initialize a newly created object",
      "To terminate the program",
      "To override methods from a superclass"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "To initialize a newly created object",
    "explanation": "A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created."

    "question": "In Python, what is the output of the following code?\n\nnums = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(nums[1])",
    "options": [
      "1",
      "2",
      "3",
      "Error"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "2",
    "explanation": "Python uses zero-based indexing. nums[1] refers to the second element, which is 2."

    "question": "Suppose you declare an array in C++ as: int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\nWhat is the value of arr[2]?",
    "options": [
      "1",
      "2",
      "3",
      "5"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "3",
    "explanation": "Arrays in C++ are zero-indexed, so arr[2] refers to the third element, which is 3."
  },
  {
    "question": "Placeholder free-response style: Write a method in Java called 'sumArray' that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of its elements.",
    "correctAnswer": "A correct implementation of sumArray should loop through the array and return the total sum.",
    "explanation": "For example: public int sumArray(int[] arr) { int sum = 0; for (int num : arr) { sum += num; } return sum; }"
  }
